# Desktop Portal

Desktop Portal is an advanced Addon for SteamVR, with a suite of tools that make doing previously difficult things in VR easy!
- Spawn in windows from your desktop, and put them anywhere you want in your playspace.
- Anchor, resize, curve, and opaci... fy? your overlays!
- A sleek and intuitive UI designed from the ground up for VR.
- Easily control music and check your FPS from the watch!
- Desktop Portal Library, a sleek and feature packed replacement for the SteamVR Library.

And now, newly open sourced!

NOTE: I apologize for any missing icons/off colors. I had to remove a bunch of paid third party assets that included icons and UI components I was using in order to make this properly open source.
